# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Environment

- **Always use `uv` for the Python environment** — never bare `pip` or `python -m venv`.
  - Create/sync the environment: `uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  - Run tools through it: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run mypy`
- Python 3.11+ is required.

## Conventions

- `src/` layout; the package lives in `src/heval`.
- Do not mention external existing R packages in code or documentation.
- Lint/format with `ruff`, type-check the public API with `mypy`, test with `pytest`.
- Every public function carries a docstring with a short worked example.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Value-of-information tutorial: `examples/voi_tutorial.py` and a website tutorial
  run EVPI, EVPPI, and EVSI end to end on the Gaussian linear decision model that
  anchors the regression VoI literature (Strong, Oakley & Brennan, 2014; Strong,
  Oakley, Brennan & Breeze, 2015), framed as a two-strategy cost-effectiveness
  decision at 30,000 per QALY. Its incremental net benefit is Normal, so EVPI,
  per-parameter EVPPI, and the EVSI of a proposed effect study have closed forms
  via the unit normal loss integral. Every estimate lands within about one percent
  of its closed form at 100,000 iterations, and a test asserts the EVPI, the EVPPI
  ranking, and the EVSI against those closed forms as a second published reference
  point ([#20](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/20)).

- Markov vs microsimulation cross-validation: `examples/markov_vs_microsim.py` and
  a website tutorial build one Sick-Sicker-style model twice, as a `MarkovModel`
  cohort trace and a `MicrosimModel` individual simulation from the same rates.
  The homogeneous microsimulation mean converges to the cohort trace within a
  fraction of a percent at 40,000 individuals, cross-validating the two engines.
  A mean-1 frailty on the progression and mortality hazards then raises the
  microsimulation QALYs about 8% above the cohort on unchanged mean rates, the
  risk heterogeneity a cohort averages away, with duration-dependent mortality as
  a short second example. A test asserts both the convergence and the divergence
  ([#18](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/18)).
- Parameter inputs from data in `heormodel.params`: `single_draw` wraps one named
  set of point values as a one-row draw matrix (iteration 0) for a base-case
  run, and `ParameterSet.at_means` is the same call on a distribution set's
  analytic means. `read_draws` validates a CSV path or DataFrame as a draw
  matrix, honouring an explicit `iteration` column and rejecting non-numeric
  columns. `resample_posterior` resamples a weighted parameter table into an
  unweighted draw matrix by drawing whole rows with replacement in proportion
  to the weights, so joint correlation survives. Each result flows through
  `run_psa` unchanged. `examples/parameter_inputs.py` and the parameter-inputs
  tutorial run all three end to end
  ([#13](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/13)).
- Deterministic sensitivity analysis: `heormodel.dsa` builds scenario designs that
  run through `run_psa` unchanged. `one_way` sweeps a single parameter,
  `one_at_a_time` sweeps each parameter in turn (the tornado design), and `grid`
  takes the full factorial of several parameters (the heatmap design). Each
  returns a `(design, descriptor)` pair: the design is a draw matrix of
  scenarios, the descriptor a tidy table naming what each scenario varied.
  `heormodel.report.tornado_data` now reads a one-way or one-at-a-time DSA result as
  well as a PSA, and `heatmap_data` reshapes a two-parameter grid into a matrix.
  `examples/dsa.py` and a website tutorial run all three forms on the
  Sick-Sicker model ([#14](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/14)).

### Changed

- Documentation narrative order: the tutorials now climb from the analysis
  layer to the most detailed engine. The sequence is bring your own outputs,
  the Markov cohort model, the microsimulation engine, Markov vs
  microsimulation models, discrete-event simulation, the full pipeline, and the
  calibration workflow. The Markov cohort tutorial moves from Replications into
  Tutorials; the time-dependent cohort and microsimulation replications stay
  under Replications as validation exhibits. Each tutorial's forward link,
  `get-started.qmd`, and the README follow the same order
  ([#19](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/19)).
- `run_psa` runs in parallel over all cores by default (`n_jobs=-1`). Pass
  `sequential=True` for an in-process run (the readable off switch for
  debugging and reproducibility checks), or `n_jobs` for an explicit worker
  count; a run with one iteration or one available core falls back to
  sequential. The numbers are identical whichever way the run is split,
  because each iteration is seeded by its index. A `progress` argument shows a
  completed-count and time-remaining readout on `stderr` as experiments
  finish, driven by the mean throughput of finished work; it is on when
  `stderr` is a terminal and quiet otherwise, so CI logs and docs builds stay
  silent unless `progress=True` is explicit
  ([#15](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/15)).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- Resonant engine names and clearer parameters (breaking, no aliases). The
  engines are now `MarkovModel` (was `MarkovCohortEngine`), `MicrosimModel`
  (folds `DiscreteTimeMicrosimEngine` and `ContinuousTimeMicrosimEngine` into
  one class with a `clock` argument, `"discrete"` by default, `"continuous"`
  for the competing-hazards path), and `DESModel` (was `DESEngine`). The Markov
  structure callback is `model_fn` in place of `build`. Every engine takes one
  `discount_rate` (annual, default `0.03`, applied to costs and effects) in
  place of `discount_cost` and `discount_effect`; `cycle_length` scales the
  annual clock. The pre-0.6 names are removed outright rather than deprecated
  ([#11](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/11)).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Cohort state-transition engine: `MarkovCohortEngine` sweeps a cohort trace
  across PSA iterations and emits `Outcomes`. Transitions may be one matrix or a
  per-cycle array (age-varying rates); rewards accrue per state and, optionally,
  per transition (a one-time cost of dying or disutility of onset). Supports
  Simpson's 1/3, half-cycle, or no within-cycle correction, reusing
  `heormodel.models._accrual` for discounting. `CohortSpec` carries one strategy's
  matrices, and `gen_wcc` builds the correction weights
  ([#9](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/9)).
- `duration_groups` on `DiscreteTimeMicrosimEngine`: a per-individual counter of
  consecutive cycles spent in a set of states, so a sojourn that progresses
  (Sick to Sicker) keeps counting where `time_in_state` would reset
  ([#9](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/9)).
- Three replications of published Sick-Sicker cost-effectiveness tutorials, each
  matching the source's deterministic results, with runnable scripts and website
  tutorials: cohort state-transition (`examples/mdm_cohort.py`), time-dependent
  cohort with age-varying mortality (`examples/mdm_cohort_timedep.py`), and
  microsimulation (`examples/mdm_microsim.py`). A replication gallery page
  collects them with citations ([#9](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/9)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Discrete-event simulation engine: `DESEngine` wraps SimPy. The environment,
  process functions, and resources stay the user's own code; the engine adds a
  per-entity toolkit for discounted cost and utility accrual, per-iteration
  seeding from a `SeedManager` so results do not depend on `n_jobs`, and an
  optional event log. It reuses `heormodel.models._accrual` and uses common random
  numbers across strategies by default, staying coherent with the
  microsimulation engines ([#8](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/8)).
- `heormodel.models.queue_waits`: derive per-request waiting times from a `DESEngine`
  trace, so queueing reports come from the event log rather than engine
  internals ([#8](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/8)).
- `simpy` as an optional dependency behind the `des` extra
  (`uv pip install 'heormodel[des]'`) ([#8](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/8)).
- Discrete-event example (`examples/des.py`) and website tutorial, validated
  against an M/M/1 queue and the exponential cohort solution
  ([#8](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/8)).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Microsimulation engines: `DiscreteTimeMicrosimEngine` advances an
  individual-level population on a cycle grid with history-dependent
  transitions and heterogeneity, and `ContinuousTimeMicrosimEngine` races
  competing time-to-event samplers between events. Both emit the standard
  `Outcomes` schema, seed each iteration from a `SeedManager` so results do not
  depend on `n_jobs`, and use common random numbers across strategies by
  default ([#7](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/7)).
- `heormodel.models._accrual`: shared cost and utility accrual, discounting, and
  aggregation to `Outcomes`, used by both engines and reserved for the
  discrete-event engine ([#7](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/7)).
- `SeedManager.child_sequence` returns a per-key seed sequence, so
  iteration-indexed streams stay identical however a run is chunked across
  workers ([#7](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/7)).
- Microsimulation example (`examples/microsim.py`) and website tutorial,
  validated against the closed-form cohort solution it mirrors
  ([#7](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/7)).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Documentation website built with Quarto and quartodoc, published to GitHub
  Pages from CI on every merge to `main`: executed tutorials, concept pages, a
  generated API reference, the roadmap, and this changelog
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/3)).
- `heormodel.params.mix_draws` combines draw matrices from different sources
  (a calibrated posterior and literature draws) into one PSA matrix,
  resampling whole rows so joint correlation survives and sources stay
  independent ([#5](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/5)).
- `capture_run` records a `draw_sources` map, so the run report shows where
  each parameter's draws came from
  ([#5](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/5)).
- Calibration workflow example (`examples/calibration_workflow.py`) and
  website tutorial: calibrate a natural-history model's rates, mix them with
  literature parameters, and run CEA and VoI on the result
  ([#5](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/5)).

### Changed

- Docstring cross-references use plain backticks instead of Sphinx roles, so
  they render cleanly on the website and in `help()`
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/3)).
- Distribution spec strings format floats at 6 significant digits, so
  provenance records and run reports stay readable
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/3)).
- `RunRecord.model_card()` renamed to `to_markdown()`, titled "Run report":
  "model card" is ML documentation jargon, not a HEOR term
  ([#6](https://github.com/pedroliman/heormodel/pull/6)).

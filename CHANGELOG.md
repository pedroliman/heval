## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation website built with Quarto and quartodoc, published to GitHub
  Pages from CI on every merge to `main`: executed tutorials, concept pages, a
  generated API reference, the roadmap, and this changelog
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heval/pull/3)).
- `heval.params.mix_draws` combines draw matrices from different sources
  (a calibrated posterior and literature draws) into one PSA matrix,
  resampling whole rows so joint correlation survives and sources stay
  independent.
- `capture_run` records a `draw_sources` map, so the model card shows where
  each parameter's draws came from.
- Calibration workflow example (`examples/calibration_workflow.py`) and
  website tutorial: calibrate a natural-history model's rates, mix them with
  literature parameters, and run CEA and VoI on the result.

### Changed

- Docstring cross-references use plain backticks instead of Sphinx roles, so
  they render cleanly on the website and in `help()`
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heval/pull/3)).
- Distribution spec strings format floats at 6 significant digits, so
  provenance records and model cards stay readable
  ([#3](https://github.com/pedroliman/heval/pull/3)).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

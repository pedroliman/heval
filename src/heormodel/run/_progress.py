"""Minimal time-remaining reporter for the PSA run loop.

Writes a single-line completed-count and time-remaining readout to
``stderr`` as experiments finish. An experiment is one unit of work the
run loop dispatches: a batch, or an iteration when unbatched. The
remaining-time estimate uses only finished experiments, so early
estimates are noisy and sharpen as the run proceeds.

This module has no third-party dependency; a stderr writer is enough.

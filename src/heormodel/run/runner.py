"""The run loop: drive a model over parameter draws, or ingest external outputs.

Two first-class entry points:

- `run_psa` evaluates a model engine (or plain function) over the
  parameter draw matrix, optionally in parallel via ``joblib``, and
  guarantees the returned outcomes carry the draws' iteration index.
- `as_outcomes` normalises a bring-your-own-outputs table (from
  any external simulator or spreadsheet export) into the standard
  `Outcomes` structure so it can flow straight
  into `heval.cea` and `heval.voi` without touching an engine.

    The draw matrix's index is the canonical iteration index: the outcomes
    returned here carry exactly that index, keeping the parameter/outcome
    linkage intact for value-of-information analysis.

    The run is parallel by default. Because each iteration draws a stream
    keyed by its index, the numbers are identical whether the run is
    parallel or sequential, and whatever the batch size; splitting only
    changes how work is dispatched, not the result.

    Args:
        model: A `ModelEngine` or a callable
            ``draws -> Outcomes``.
        draws: Parameter draw matrix (rows = iterations), e.g. from
            `heval.params.ParameterSet.sample`.
        n_jobs: ``joblib`` worker count; ``-1`` (default) uses all cores.
        sequential: Run in-process on one worker, the readable off switch
            for debugging and reproducibility checks. Forces sequential
            whatever ``n_jobs`` says. The run also falls back to sequential
            when there is one iteration or one available core.
        batch_size: Rows per experiment (default: split evenly across
            workers, four batches per worker). One experiment is one unit of
            work the loop dispatches, and the progress readout counts these.
        progress: Show a completed-count and time-remaining readout on
            ``stderr`` as experiments finish. ``None`` (default) shows it
            when ``stderr`` is a terminal and stays quiet otherwise, so CI
            logs and docs builds are silent; ``True`` forces it on, ``False``
            off. The remaining-time estimate uses only finished experiments,
            so early estimates are noisy and sharpen over the run.

    Returns:
        Outcomes with iteration index equal to ``draws.index``.

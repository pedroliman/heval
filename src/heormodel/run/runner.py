"""The run loop: drive a model over parameter draws, or ingest external outputs.

Two first-class entry points:

- `run_psa` evaluates a model engine (or plain function) over the
  parameter draw matrix, optionally in parallel via ``joblib``, and
  returns a `RunResult` whose outcomes carry the draws' iteration index. It
  owns execution: it builds the per-iteration random streams from its ``seed``
  argument and gathers the optional event or individual logs, so engines stay
  seed-free descriptions of a model.
- `as_outcomes` normalises a bring-your-own-outputs table (from
  any external simulator or spreadsheet export) into the standard
  `Outcomes` structure so it can flow straight
  into `heormodel.cea` and `heormodel.voi` without touching an engine.

    """Evaluate a model over the parameter draw matrix, preserving its index.

    This is the single execution point. It owns every execution concern: it
    builds the per-iteration random streams from ``seed`` and hands them to a
    stochastic engine, runs the batches in parallel, gathers any ``collect``
    log, and returns a `RunResult`. Engines themselves hold no seed and no side
    channel, so the same model object reruns under a new ``seed`` without
    reconstruction.

    The draw matrix's index is the canonical iteration index: the outcomes carry
    exactly that index, keeping the parameter/outcome linkage intact for
    value-of-information analysis.

    The run is parallel by default. Because each iteration draws a stream keyed
    by its index, the numbers, and any collected log, are identical whether the
    run is parallel or sequential, and whatever the batch size; splitting only
    changes how work is dispatched, not the result.

    Args:
        model: A `ModelEngine` or a callable ``draws -> Outcomes``.
        draws: Parameter draw matrix (rows = iterations), e.g. from
            `heormodel.params.ParameterSet.sample`.
        seed: Root seed for the per-iteration streams a stochastic engine uses.
            ``None`` (default) draws fresh entropy; pass an integer for a
            reproducible run. Ignored by deterministic engines.
        collect: ``None`` (default) returns outcomes only. ``"events"`` also
            gathers the state-change or resource history, and ``"individuals"``
            the per-individual accruals, into the `RunResult`. Only a stochastic
            engine produces these; asking a deterministic model for them raises.
        n_jobs: ``joblib`` worker count; ``-1`` (default) uses all cores.
        sequential: Run in-process on one worker, the readable off switch
            for debugging and reproducibility checks. Forces sequential
            whatever ``n_jobs`` says. The run also falls back to sequential
            when there is one iteration or one available core.
        batch_size: Rows per experiment (default: split evenly across
            workers, four batches per worker). One experiment is one unit of
            work the loop dispatches, and the progress readout counts these.
        progress: Show a completed-count and time-remaining readout on
            ``stderr`` as experiments finish. ``None`` (default) shows it
            when ``stderr`` is a terminal and stays quiet otherwise, so CI
            logs and docs builds are silent; ``True`` forces it on, ``False``
            off. The remaining-time estimate uses only finished experiments,
            so early estimates are noisy and sharpen over the run.

    Returns:
        A `RunResult` whose ``outcomes`` iteration index equals ``draws.index``.

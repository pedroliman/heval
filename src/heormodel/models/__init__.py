"""Model engines behind an output contract (`heval.models`).

The durable pieces here are `Outcomes`, the standardized
(strategy, iteration) outcome structure, and `ModelEngine`, the
contract every engine satisfies. The engines are `MarkovModel`
(cohort state-transition), `MicrosimModel` (individual-level, discrete- or
continuous-time via ``clock``), and `DESModel` (discrete-event, wrapping
SimPy). `state_occupancy` turns an individual-level event history into the
proportion of the population in each state over time.

"""The model engine protocol: a contract on outputs, not internals.

Engines differ radically inside (cohort matrix algebra, individual-level
simulation, discrete-event simulation) and deliberately do **not** share an
implementation API. What they share is this: given a parameter draw matrix,
an engine returns an `Outcomes` object whose
iteration index matches the draws it was given. Analysis code depends only
on that contract and never reaches into engine internals.

    """Anything that turns parameter draws into standardized outcomes.

    Implementations must satisfy two invariants:

    1. The returned `Outcomes` iteration index equals ``draws.index``
       (same values, same order); this preserves the parameter/outcome
       linkage required by EVPPI and EVSI.
    2. Every strategy is evaluated on every iteration (a balanced panel);
       the `Outcomes` constructor enforces this.

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from heormodel.models import ModelEngine, Outcomes
        >>> class TwoStrategyModel:
        ...     def evaluate(self, draws: pd.DataFrame) -> Outcomes:

"""Individual-level (microsimulation) engine.

`MicrosimModel` simulates an individual-level population per parameter draw and
returns the standard `Outcomes` structure. One class covers two clocks, each
built through its own constructor so a call carries only the parameters its
kernel uses:

- `MicrosimModel.discrete` advances every individual on a fixed cycle grid,
  sampling state transitions from per-cycle probabilities. History dependence
  enters through attribute columns the engine maintains (``cycle`` and
  ``time_in_state``). Supply a ``transition_probabilities`` function and
  per-cycle ``state_rewards``.
- `MicrosimModel.continuous` races competing time-to-event samplers, takes the
  earliest, and accrues continuously between events. No cycle grid; the horizon
  truncates. Supply an ``event_times`` function and per-year
  ``state_reward_rates``.

The engine configures once and evaluates on draws: the constructor takes the
model structure, and `evaluate` takes only the parameter draw matrix, returning
`Outcomes` indexed by ``draws.index``. Randomness comes from a `SeedManager`
injected at construction; each iteration draws a stream keyed by its index, so
iteration ``i`` is reproducible in isolation and results do not depend on how a
run is chunked across workers. Cost and utility accrual, discounting, and
aggregation live in the shared `heormodel.models._accrual` module.

class MicrosimModel(_MicrosimBase):
    """Individual-level microsimulation engine, discrete- or continuous-time.

    Build one with `MicrosimModel.discrete` or `MicrosimModel.continuous`. Each
    constructor carries only the parameters its kernel uses, so a parameter that
    belongs to the other clock is a `TypeError` at the call site.

    The discrete clock vectorizes over individuals and loops over cycles. The
    state is an integer vector; each cycle one ``rng.random(n)`` draw and a
    cumulative-probability comparison samples the next state. History enters
    through two attribute columns the engine maintains and passes to
    ``transition_probabilities`` and ``state_rewards``: ``cycle`` (0-based cycle
    index) and ``time_in_state`` (cycles the individual has spent in its current
    state).

    The continuous clock races competing time-to-event samplers. ``event_times``
    returns sampled times to each competing event; the engine takes the
    earliest, advances the clock to it, and accrues cost and utility continuously
    over the elapsed segment. There is no cycle grid; ``horizon`` truncates. The
    current clock is passed to ``event_times`` and ``state_reward_rates`` as a
    ``time`` attribute column.

    ``discount_rate`` is an annual rate on an annual clock. ``cycle_length``
    scales the discrete clock: with ``cycle_length=0.5`` each cycle discounts
    by half a year.

    Every user-supplied model function receives the intervention name as its second
    argument, so an intervention can branch on the name as well as through parameter
    decision levers.

    Example:
        >>> import numpy as np, pandas as pd
        >>> from heormodel.models import MicrosimModel
        >>> def transition_probabilities(params, intervention, state, attrs, rng):

        ...     probs[state == 0] = [1 - params["p_die"], params["p_die"]]
        ...     probs[state == 1] = [0.0, 1.0]  # dead is absorbing
        ...     return probs
        >>> def state_rewards(params, intervention, state, attrs):
        ...     alive = (state == 0).astype(float)
        ...     return alive * params["cost"], alive

            n_cycles: Number of cycles to simulate.
            population: Attribute sampler ``fn(rng, n) -> DataFrame`` for
                heterogeneity, or an ``int`` count for a featureless population.
                ``None`` uses ``n_individuals`` with no attributes.
            cycle_length: Years per cycle; scales the discount clock.

            independent_streams: Give each intervention its own population and
                simulation stream instead of common random numbers.
            duration_groups: Optional map of attribute name to a set of state
                labels. For each entry the engine maintains a per-individual
                counter of consecutive cycles spent in that set of states (0 on

        Randomness is supplied by `heormodel.run.run_psa` at run time, not at
        construction; the engine holds no seed of its own.

        Args:
            states: State labels; the first is the default starting state.
            event_times: ``fn(params, intervention, state, attrs, rng) -> times``,
                shape ``(n, n_states)``, the sampled time to each destination
                state. Use ``inf`` where a transition cannot occur, including a
                state's own column and every column of an absorbing state.
            state_reward_rates: ``fn(params, intervention, state, attrs) ->
                (cost_rate, utility_rate)``, the per-year cost and utility flows
                of each individual's current state, each shape ``(n,)``.
            interventions: A sequence of intervention names or
                `heormodel.models.Intervention` objects; an `Intervention` may carry
                parameter decision levers merged into ``params`` for that intervention.
                Order is preserved in `Outcomes`.
            horizon: Time horizon in years; trajectories truncate here.
            population: Attribute sampler ``fn(rng, n) -> DataFrame`` for
                heterogeneity, or an ``int`` count for a featureless population.
                ``None`` uses ``n_individuals`` with no attributes.
            discount_rate: Annual discount rate for costs and effects (0.03 by
                default).
            n_individuals: Population size when ``population`` is a sampler or
                ``None``.
            initial_state: Starting state label or index.
            effect: Name of the effect column (QALYs by default).
            independent_streams: Give each intervention its own population and
                simulation stream instead of common random numbers.
            max_events: Safety cap on events per individual before raising.

"""Discrete-event simulation engine, a thin wrapper around SimPy.

`DESModel` runs a SimPy model once per parameter draw and intervention and returns
the standard `Outcomes` structure. It is not a new discrete-event kernel: the SimPy
``Environment``, the process functions, and the ``Resource`` objects stay the
user's own code. `heormodel` adds only what SimPy leaves out for a health economic
model:

- a per-entity `_DESToolkit` for cost and utility accrual with discounting,
  reusing `heormodel.models._accrual` between events exactly as the continuous-time
  microsimulation engine does,
- per-iteration seeding from a `SeedManager`, so results do not depend on how a
  run is chunked across workers,
- an optional per-entity event log (the trace side channel), from which queueing
  and utilization reports are derived without touching engine internals.

The engine keeps the same three commitments as the microsimulation engines.
Configure once and evaluate on draws: the constructor takes the model, and
`evaluate` takes only the parameter draw matrix, returning `Outcomes` indexed by
``draws.index``. Seed each iteration from an injected `SeedManager`. Accrue and
discount through the shared `_accrual` module. Discounting is continuous
(``exp(-rate * t)``), matching `MicrosimModel(clock="continuous")`, because a DES runs
in continuous time.

``simpy`` is an optional dependency: install with ``uv pip install 'heormodel[des]'``.

    Each process is the user's own SimPy code with signature
    ``process(env, entity, params, intervention, toolkit)``. ``entity`` is that
    individual's attribute row, ``params`` the iteration's draw merged with the
    intervention decision levers, ``intervention`` the intervention name, and ``toolkit`` the
    `_DESToolkit` that accrues cost and effect and logs the trajectory. Per
    iteration and intervention the engine builds the environment, samples entities,
    creates the shared resources, runs every process to ``horizon``, collects the
    per-entity discounted accruals, averages them, and writes one `Outcomes` row.

    Args:
        process: The SimPy process factory, ``fn(env, entity, params, intervention,
            toolkit)`` returning a generator.
        population: Attribute sampler ``fn(rng, n) -> DataFrame``, an ``int``
            count for a featureless population, or ``None`` to use
            ``n_individuals`` with no attributes.
        interventions: A sequence of intervention names or `heormodel.models.Intervention`
            objects; an `Intervention` may carry parameter decision levers merged into
            ``params`` for that intervention. Order is preserved in `Outcomes`.
        resources: ``fn(env, params, intervention) -> dict[str, simpy.Resource]``,
            built fresh for each run and shared by every entity in it. ``None``
            for a model with no constrained resources.
        horizon: Time horizon in the environment's unit; the run stops here. Each
            process reads it back as ``toolkit.horizon``.
        discount_rate: Annual (per-unit-time) discount rate for costs and
            effects (0.03 by default). Discounting is continuous
            (``exp(-rate * t)``).
        n_individuals: Population size when ``population`` is a sampler or
            ``None``.
        effect: Name of the effect column (QALYs by default).
        independent_streams: Give each intervention its own population and streams
            instead of common random numbers.

    Randomness is supplied by `heormodel.run.run_psa` at run time, not at
    construction; the engine holds no seed of its own.

def queue_waits(trace: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Per-request waiting times, derived from a `DESModel` trace.

    Pairs each ``request`` event with its ``grant`` for the same entity, intervention,
    iteration, and resource, and reports the wait between them. This is the
    pattern the design intends: queueing reports come from the event log, so
    analysis code never reaches into the engine.

    Args:
        trace: The event log from ``run_psa(engine, draws, collect="events").events``.

    Returns:
        One row per served request with a ``wait`` column.

    Example:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from heormodel.models.des import queue_waits
        >>> trace = pd.DataFrame({
        ...     "intervention": ["s", "s"], "iteration": [0, 0], "entity": [0, 0],
        ...     "t": [1.0, 4.0], "event": ["request", "grant"],
        ...     "state": [None, None], "resource": ["clinic", "clinic"]})
        >>> float(queue_waits(trace)["wait"].iloc[0])
        3.0
    """

"""Ordinary differential equation (compartmental) engine.

`ODEModel` evaluates a system of ordinary differential equations across
population compartments and returns the standard `Outcomes` structure. It suits
infectious-disease models, where a force of infection couples the compartments
non-linearly and the natural description is a rate of change per compartment
rather than a per-cycle transition probability. A susceptible-exposed-infectious
-recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination is the worked example in
`examples/seir_vaccination.py`.

The engine follows the same shape as the other engines. The constructor takes
the model structure (compartments as states, interventions, a
``dynamics_and_rewards`` function, the time horizon, and discounting);
``evaluate`` takes only the parameter draw matrix and returns `Outcomes` indexed
by ``draws.index``. A system of ordinary differential equations is deterministic
given a parameter set, so no random streams are involved and the engine
satisfies `heormodel.models.ModelEngine`.

Rewards follow the same two channels as the cohort engine, adapted to
continuous time. State rewards are per-year cost and utility flows that accrue
on compartment occupancy: the integral over the horizon of ``occupancy dot
state_cost``, discounted continuously. Flow rewards attach a one-time amount to
a rate of movement, for costs that fall on an event rather than a state, such as
the cost of each vaccine dose administered (the vaccination flow) or the cost of
treating each new infection (the incidence flow). Discounting reuses
`heormodel.models._accrual`; the engine augments the system with two
accumulator equations so the same adaptive integrator that advances the
compartments also integrates the discounted reward flows.

    Args:
        derivatives: The right-hand side of the system, ``fn(t, y) -> dy/dt``,
            where ``t`` is time in years and ``y`` is the compartment vector,
            shape ``(n_states,)``. Returns the instantaneous rate of change of
            each compartment, same shape.
        initial: Initial compartment sizes at ``t = 0``, shape ``(n_states,)``.
            Their sum is the population scale; costs and effects come out in the
            same units, so an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is unaffected
            by it.
        state_cost: Per-year cost of each unit of occupancy in each compartment,
            shape ``(n_states,)``. The occupancy integral of this vector is the
            discounted cost that accrues while individuals sit in a compartment.
        state_effect: Per-year effect (quality-adjusted life-years) of each unit
            of occupancy in each compartment, shape ``(n_states,)``.
        event_rates: Optional ``fn(t, y) -> rates`` returning the per-year rate
            of each tracked flow event, shape ``(n_events,)``. A flow event is a
            movement between compartments carrying a one-time amount, such as a
            vaccination or a new infection. ``None`` when the model has no
            flow-based rewards.
        event_cost: One-time cost charged per unit of each flow event, shape
            ``(n_events,)``. Required when ``event_rates`` is given.
        event_effect: One-time effect charged per unit of each flow event, shape
            ``(n_events,)``. Required when ``event_rates`` is given; pass zeros
            when the events carry cost only.

        method: Integration method passed to ``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``
            (``"RK45"`` by default; ``"LSODA"`` switches automatically to a stiff
            solver when the dynamics stiffen).

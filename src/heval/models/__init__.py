"""Model engines behind an output contract (:mod:`heval.models`).

The durable piece here is :class:`Outcomes` — the standardized
(strategy, iteration) outcome schema — and :class:`ModelEngine`, the
protocol every engine satisfies. Engine implementations (cohort
state-transition, microsimulation, discrete-event) arrive in later phases;
their stubs document the planned designs.

"""Individual-level (microsimulation) engines (planned, not yet implemented).

Planned design (phase 3):

- ``DiscreteTimeMicrosimEngine``: individual state-transition simulation on a
  fixed cycle grid with individual-level heterogeneity and history-dependent
  transition probabilities.
- ``ContinuousTimeMicrosimEngine``: competing time-to-event sampling from
  parametric hazards, no cycle grid.
- Both simulate a population per PSA iteration (with seeds spawned by
  :class:`heval.run.SeedManager`), average within iteration, and emit the
  standard :class:`~heval.models.outcomes.Outcomes` schema. Internals are
  deliberately not shared with the cohort engine; the output contract is
  the only common surface.

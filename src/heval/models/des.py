"""Discrete-event simulation engine — planned, not yet implemented.

Planned design (phase 4): a thin wrapper around SimPy rather than a new DES
kernel. ``heval`` adds only what SimPy does not provide for health economic
models:

- patient trajectory recording (event log per entity),
- resource-constraint helpers (queues, capacities) mapped to costs,
- continuous cost and utility accrual between events with discounting,
- per-iteration seeding via :class:`heval.run.SeedManager`, and
- aggregation of entity-level accruals into the standard
  :class:`~heval.models.outcomes.Outcomes` schema.

The SimPy environment and process functions remain the user's own code;
this engine never hides or re-implements the simulation loop.

"""Cohort state-transition (Markov) engine — planned, not yet implemented.

Planned design (phase 2):

- Strategies defined by a transition-probability matrix builder
  ``build_matrix(params: pd.Series) -> ndarray`` plus per-state cost and
  utility payoffs, cycle length, horizon, discounting, and optional
  half-cycle correction.
- Vectorised evaluation across PSA iterations: one matrix-power sweep per
  iteration chunk, accumulating discounted costs and QALYs per strategy.
- Output: the standard :class:`~heval.models.outcomes.Outcomes` schema,
  optionally with per-state cost components. Nothing beyond that schema is
  exposed to the analysis layer.

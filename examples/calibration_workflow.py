"""End-to-end example: calibrate some parameters, take the rest from the
literature, then mix both into one PSA that flows through CEA and VoI.

This is the workflow most applied models need. A natural-history model has
transition rates that no single study reports, so they are calibrated to
observed prevalence. Utilities and costs come from the literature as
mean/SE distributions. `heormodel.params.mix_draws` joins the calibrated
posterior and the literature draws into one matrix, and from that point the
analysis layer does not care where a parameter came from.

The disease model is a three-state continuous-time Markov chain over Healthy,
Sick, and Dead, starting at age 40. Two rates are calibrated:

    onset:       Healthy -> Sick hazard
    progression: excess Sick -> Dead hazard

Treatment multiplies the progression hazard by ``rr_progression`` (a
literature parameter), buying time in the Sick state at cost ``c_treat`` per
year. Discounted state occupancy is the closed-form integral of the
transition matrix, ``e0 @ (r I - Q)^-1``, so no time loop is needed.

Run it with::

    uv pip install -e '.[calibration]'
    uv run python examples/calibration_workflow.py

Outputs (written to ``examples/output/``):
    - ce_plane_calib.png, ceac_calib.png, frontier_calib.png, tornado_calib.png
    - run_report_calib.md, run_record_calib.json

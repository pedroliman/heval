"""Transition costs and utilities accrued over the sojourn that ends in each event.

The companion cost function does not pay the transition amounts once at the
event. It adds each (the onset cost and disutility, and the cost of dying) to
the annual flow of the sojourn that ends in the transition, then multiplies by
the discounted length of that sojourn, so a $2,000 cost of dying enters as
$2,000 per year over the whole final sojourn. These functions reconstruct that
arithmetic from the event history, which is why the amounts are not part of the
engine's per-year valuation.

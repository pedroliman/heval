# Releasing heormodel

How to cut a release after a PR merges to `main`. Release often: a single
bug fix or small feature is enough to justify a patch release.

## After every merge to main

Every PR that changes behavior adds one line under `## [Unreleased]` in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), linking to the PR. Nothing else is required;
`main` is always releasable.

## Cutting a release

1. Pick the version bump under [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
   `patch` for fixes, `minor` for backward-compatible features, `major` for
   breaking changes.
2. On `main`, update `version` in `pyproject.toml`.
3. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`,
   add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and update the link
   references at the bottom of the file.
4. Commit as `Release vX.Y.Z`, merge to `main` through a pull request.
5. On merge, the `Release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs
   its `tag` job: reads the version from `pyproject.toml`, tags the merge
   commit `vX.Y.Z`, and creates a GitHub release from the matching
   `CHANGELOG.md` section, using the `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret (see one-time
   setup below) so the release is attributed to the repository owner rather
   than `github-actions[bot]`. Its `publish` job then builds the package with
   `uv build` and publishes it to PyPI. Both jobs run in the same workflow
   deliberately, so the publish job's PyPI trusted-publisher identity is
   always `release.yml`, whichever job triggered it.
6. If a publish is ever stuck for a tag that already has a GitHub release
   (check the `Release` workflow runs in the `Actions` tab), trigger
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` manually: `Actions` -> `Release` -> `Run
   workflow`, entering the tag (e.g. `v0.7.0`). This runs only the `publish`
   job, since `tag` is skipped for a manual `workflow_dispatch` run.

## One-time release attribution setup

The `tag` job authenticates as the repository owner rather than the default
`github-actions[bot]`, so the GitHub release it creates shows as released by
the owner. Create a fine-grained personal access token, scoped to this
repository only, with the `Contents: Read and write` repository permission
(under [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)),
then add it as a repository secret named `RELEASE_TOKEN` (`Settings` ->
`Secrets and variables` -> `Actions` -> `New repository secret`). Rotate it
before expiry; the workflow fails the `tag` job's `gh` calls if it lapses.

## One-time PyPI setup

The release workflow publishes via
[PyPI trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/), no API
token stored in the repo. On the `heormodel` project's PyPI page, under
`Publishing`, add a trusted publisher for this repository:

- Owner: `pedroliman`, repository: `heormodel`
- Workflow file: `release.yml`
- Environment: `pypi`

## Zenodo archive

Every GitHub release also archives to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) with a
DOI, once the one-time setup below is done. No workflow step is needed:
Zenodo's GitHub integration registers its own repository webhook (under
`Settings` -> `Webhooks`) that fires on the `release: published` event
directly, independent of GitHub Actions.

Zenodo reads archive metadata from [`.zenodo.json`](.zenodo.json); GitHub's
own "Cite this repository" button reads [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).
When both files are present, Zenodo uses `.zenodo.json` and ignores
`CITATION.cff`. Update `.zenodo.json` if the title, authors, or keywords
change; there is no version field to keep in sync; each archived record
takes its version from the release tag.

One-time setup, done by the repository owner on zenodo.org (cannot be
scripted, requires the owner's GitHub OAuth login):

1. Sign in at [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) with the GitHub account that
   owns this repository, and open the
   [GitHub integration settings](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/).
2. Click "Sync now" if `heormodel` is not in the repository list yet.
3. Toggle `heormodel` on. This is a one-time step; every release published
   afterward archives automatically.
4. After the first archive completes, copy the "concept DOI" badge Zenodo
   shows for the repository (the one that always resolves to the latest
   version) into the README's badge row.

## Checks before releasing

`CI` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, and the
doctest suite on every push and PR to `main`. Do not tag a release on top of
a red `main`.
